                    <h3>Buy Direct From <span>The Roaster And Save</span></h3>
                    <p>
                        Coffee is a commodity.  But unlike other commodities, there is a diverse range of quality and cost options
                        available.  The general rule is the lower the cost of the coffee, the lower the quality of coffee.  Alpine Coffee is the exception.  
                        We buy our beans directly from the farmers in Africa, and we own and operate our own mill.  People that we directly employee sort and 
                        package the raw beans for export, which are then transported to our roasting facility in Denver.  With Alpine Coffee, there are no middlemen.  
                        We own the entire supply chain, from coffee tree in Africa to final roasting in Denver, Colorado.  This is unique, very few coffee companies do this.  
                        It took the owner, George Yost, many years to perfect this process.  The result: Alpine Coffee is able to offer excellent tasting, quality coffee at economy coffee prices.  
                        In turn, this gives our hotel customers a unique chance to both save money while improving the guest experience.
                    </p>

                        As guests become more environmentally conscious, they will appreciate your hotel has made a sustainable choice.  We provide an in-room placard that educates your guests about the 
                        coffee they are drinking.

                    <p>How a coffee is processed after harvest can have a dramatic effect on the resulting cup, so it has become an increasingly important part of how it is described and sold.  It would be a mistake to believ ethat coffee producers have flavor in mind when they choose their processing methods.

                    <h3>Traceabiliy</h3>
                    <p>There are thousands of coffee roasters.  Not all of them can be good and variations in price and the way they are marketed can make buying fairly confusing.  With Alpine, you can trace your coffee back to the farm the beans originated from.  In an industry plauged by ethical concerns, and dogged by an image of explotation of the Third World, knowing exactly where a coffee comes from is a powerful piece of information" -- James Hoffman

                    <h3>Fair Trade</h3>
                    <p>There remains some confusion about exactly how Fair Trade works, although it has undoubtedly become a successful tool to help those who wish to purchase coffee with a clear conscience.  Many people presume that the promises of Fair Trade are far wider reaching than they actually are, and that any coffee could be certified as Fair Trade.  This is not the case.  And to make matters worse, it is easy for detractors to allege that the farmer is not getting the premium because of the complex nature of financial transactions within the coffee industry.

                <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. 
                    The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, 
                    content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, 
                    and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over.

                <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, 
                    a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, 
                    and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. 
                    Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, 
                    written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", 
                    comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
